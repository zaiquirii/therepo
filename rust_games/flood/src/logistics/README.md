# Logistics System

I'm thinking that the markdown system will be made up of two parts:

- The dispatcher
- The delivery system

## The Dispatcher (Inventory Manager)

The dispatcher tracks providers and consumers, matching requests with existing inventory.

# Delivery System

Takes care of getting packets from providers to consumers.
